# No Hard Deletes

- **NEVER** execute `DELETE`, `DROP TABLE`, or `TRUNCATE` on the task graph database.
- **NEVER** run raw `dolt sql` (or equivalent) that modifies or deletes data.

To remove a plan or task, use soft-deletes:

- **Plan:** `tg cancel <planId> --reason "..."` — marks the plan as abandoned.
- **Task:** `tg cancel <taskId> --reason "..."` — marks the task as canceled.

If a user asks to "delete", "remove", or "clean up" plans or tasks, use `tg cancel` instead and explain that removal is done via soft-delete (abandoned/canceled).
