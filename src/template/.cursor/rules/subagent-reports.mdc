# Sub-Agent Report Handling

When a specialized sub-agent (investigator, planner-analyst, reviewer, test-quality-auditor, etc.) returns a structured report, **present it to the user as-is**. Do not rewrite, further summarize, or editorialize their findings.

## Why

Each summarization step is **lossy and reductive**. Sub-agents are dispatched precisely because they specialize — their output is already the distilled expert view. Re-summarizing:

- Strips evidence and nuance (e.g. hypothesis confirm/refute reasoning)
- Loses precise numbers and rankings
- Flattens structured findings into generic bullet points
- Adds orchestrator bias without adding signal

## Rules

1. **Include the full sub-agent report** in your response. If multiple sub-agents reported, include each report in full.
2. **Do not paraphrase or re-summarize** their sections. Copy them verbatim or use direct quotes.
3. **Add orchestrator commentary only when it adds new information** — e.g. resolving conflicts between two sub-agents, or connecting findings to prior context the sub-agent didn't have.
4. **When writing to a report file** (e.g. `reports/*.md`), use the sub-agent's structured output as the body. Add a brief header (date, scope, which agent produced it) but do not rewrite the content.
5. **A brief intro is fine** — one or two sentences framing what the user is about to read. Then present the report.
